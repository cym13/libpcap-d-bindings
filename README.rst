Description
===========

Simple bindings to libpcap. Not everything was tested and if it works on
Windows it will definitely be by accident. Otherwise I use it for my own
projects so it should be usable.

Pull requests are welcomed.

Dependencies
============

None, although libpcap itself isn't provided.
